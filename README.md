# Intention
Create and Copy Objects for Workshops

For teaching purposes it is often needed to copy objects for each participant.
This report does the follwing for the selected user:
* create a transport request
* Create a new package
* copy a given report
* copy a given class

A definition can be saved as variant so that every participant can create/ copy its own objects.
It's possible to add notes for additional advise (further documentation, manual steps to be done, ...)

# Outlook
* copy further objects (message class, tables, structures, ...)
* copy all objects of an existing package
* copy multiple objects (reports, classes)
